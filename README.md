# Django Project Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run a Django project on XAMPP server with MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

- XAMPP installed on your system.
- and the name you have created the database for this project.
- Python installed on your system. You can download Python from (https://github.com/gabrielzawadi33/healthcare_notification_system.git).
- Django framework installed. You can install Django via pip:
- make sure  you have created the virtualenvironment and is well activated

    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

- MySQLClient installed. You can install MySQLClient via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install mysqlclient
    ```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository of your Django project to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/gabrielzawadi33/healthcare_notification_system.git.>
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt, and change directory to your project folder:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. **Install Project Dependencies**: Install the required Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Database Configuration**: Configure your MySQL database settings in the `settings.py` file of your Django project. Update the following settings:

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': '<database-name>',
            'USER': '<database-username>',
            'PASSWORD': '<database-password>',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '3306',
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `<database-name>`, `<database-username>`, and `<database-password>` with your MySQL database details.

5. **Migrate Database**: Run database migrations to create necessary tables in your MySQL database:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create Superuser (Optional)**: If you need to create a superuser for the Django admin interface, run the following command and follow the prompts:

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Start XAMPP Server**: Start your XAMPP server and ensure that Apache and MySQL services are running.

8. **Run Django Project**: Finally, run your Django project:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

9. **Access Django Admin Interface**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to access the Django admin interface. Log in with the superuser credentials created earlier (if applicable).

## Additional Notes

- Make sure that XAMPP server is running whenever you want to run your Django project.
- Always keep your `settings.py` file updated with correct database configurations.
- Don't forget to create backups of your database regularly to prevent data loss.
